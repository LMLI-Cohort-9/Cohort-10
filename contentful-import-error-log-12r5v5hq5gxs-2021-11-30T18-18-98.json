Today I'm talking to Rebecca Gruenberg, who is a junior Computer Science major about her work with Cohort IX's Envision 2040 project, Envision 2040 imagines how the world would look in 20 years with a special focus on diversity, inclusion, technology and human interaction with technology. So, Rebecca, why is Envision 2040 so important?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 0:28__\nYeah, well, you know, the world is becoming increasingly more technologically focused, you know, at really an exponential pace. But that means that there's going to be a lot more changes and much shorter amount of time. So our Envision 2040 project is really meant to address how you can navigate, you know, these copious amounts of change, and what the future might look like. So we can better prepare ourselves for it. Um, you know, we can't, you know, see the future, we can't tell the future. But we can look at current trends and progressions in order to best understand the direction that we're going, as individuals and as a society in this digital age.\n\n__Elise Belanger 1:03__\nGreat. So what insights have you gotten from exploring this topic?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 1:09__\nYeah, well, I worked on the embracing inclusion lens of our project, which is really just about discovering those demographic changes and trends going towards 2040. Especially, you know, when the United States specifically becomes a much more diverse nation, which means we really need to be creating more engaging and inclusive workplaces. But more specifically, I worked on an article about algorithmic bias, and how it really promotes a lot of prejudice. And stereotypes, I was really surprised about how pervasive that can be, especially within, you know, different search engines, considering that searches are optimized for the user. And that can really be an issue when it comes to those, you know, targeting results, which start to display a lot of bias and discrimination. So really being mindful about, you know, searches in the expected audience. And then those their biases is really important. And it's really an insight that has to be kept in mind as tech gets more and more advanced. And as the world gets more and more diverse.\n\n__Elise Belanger 2:06__\nGreat. So what are you doing personally, to prepare for the future?\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 2:12__\nYeah, the key thing that I'm really doing to prepare for the future is working on recognizing you know, key patterns and trends. And then working on mastering or at least trying to stay up to date on you know, all these new forms of technology that can that started, you know, coming out or just becoming more mainstream. The book \"Thinking in the Future Tense\", by Jennifer James has some really great insights on how to prepare your mind and change your habits, specifically as an individual to get the most out of the present. So I definitely would recommend that book. But ultimately, just really learning to recognize trends in technology, and diversity and the way we interact with one another will really be key and understanding, you know, short term and long term changes. Staying up to date on technology, then, of course, helps me one as a computer science major, you know, understand relevant stuff in my own field and industry, but then also better understand what the future of work and our personal lives look like going forward.\n\n__Elise Belanger 3:12__\nThat's great. I think I'm gonna check out that book. So thank you for speaking with us today.\n\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 3:13__\nYeah, of course. Thank you."

Today I'm talking to Rebecca Gruenberg, who is a junior Computer Science major about her work with Cohort IX's Envision 2040 project, Envision 2040 imagines how the world would look in 20 years with a special focus on diversity, inclusion, technology and human interaction with technology. So, Rebecca, why is Envision 2040 so important?\\n\\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 0:28__\\nYeah, well, you know, the world is becoming increasingly more technologically focused, you know, at really an exponential pace. But that means that there's going to be a lot more changes and much shorter amount of time. So our Envision 2040 project is really meant to address how you can navigate, you know, these copious amounts of change, and what the future might look like. So we can better prepare ourselves for it. Um, you know, we can't, you know, see the future, we can't tell the future. But we can look at current trends and progressions in order to best understand the direction that we're going, as individuals and as a society in this digital age.\\n\\n__Elise Belanger 1:03__\\nGreat. So what insights have you gotten from exploring this topic?\\n\\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 1:09__\\nYeah, well, I worked on the embracing inclusion lens of our project, which is really just about discovering those demographic changes and trends going towards 2040. Especially, you know, when the United States specifically becomes a much more diverse nation, which means we really need to be creating more engaging and inclusive workplaces. But more specifically, I worked on an article about algorithmic bias, and how it really promotes a lot of prejudice. And stereotypes, I was really surprised about how pervasive that can be, especially within, you know, different search engines, considering that searches are optimized for the user. And that can really be an issue when it comes to those, you know, targeting results, which start to display a lot of bias and discrimination. So really being mindful about, you know, searches in the expected audience. And then those their biases is really important. And it's really an insight that has to be kept in mind as tech gets more and more advanced. And as the world gets more and more diverse.\\n\\n__Elise Belanger 2:06__\\nGreat. So what are you doing personally, to prepare for the future?\\n\\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 2:12__\\nYeah, the key thing that I'm really doing to prepare for the future is working on recognizing you know, key patterns and trends. And then working on mastering or at least trying to stay up to date on you know, all these new forms of technology that can that started, you know, coming out or just becoming more mainstream. The book \\\"Thinking in the Future Tense\\\", by Jennifer James has some really great insights on how to prepare your mind and change your habits, specifically as an individual to get the most out of the present. So I definitely would recommend that book. But ultimately, just really learning to recognize trends in technology, and diversity and the way we interact with one another will really be key and understanding, you know, short term and long term changes. Staying up to date on technology, then, of course, helps me one as a computer science major, you know, understand relevant stuff in my own field and industry, but then also better understand what the future of work and our personal lives look like going forward.\\n\\n__Elise Belanger 3:12__\\nThat's great. I think I'm gonna check out that book. So thank you for speaking with us today.\\n\\n__Rebecca Gruenburg 3:13__\\nYeah, of course. Thank you.\"},\"linkedIn\":{\"en-US\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebeccagruenberg/\"}}}"

I'm a junior chemical engineering major in cohort nine and as she said, our project is about envisioning 2040.\n\n__Sofia Stout 0:26__\nYeah. So what can you tell us about the project? And why is it important?\n\n__Phillip Loges 0:30__\nSo our project, Envision 2040, is about thinking ahead and being more proactive toward your future, specifically, more than next 20 years. And it's important because many people don't really realize how much change we're seeing in short periods of time. And our technological advancements are growing at an exponential rate now and a world is even seeing them demographic shifts. So it's important for people to keep up with those times. And if you look back at it, people are now holding supercomputers that are better than what NASA sent people to the moon on and they're holding those in their pockets. And these people are seeing these changes in those people alive right now that had car phones, which nobody really knows what they are anymore. So we're seeing advancements like never before. And specifically, my topic in our project is about what kind of future tech we will see integrated into our daily lives. And we're focusing on Elon Musk's neural link a little bit. And soon we'll be seeing technologies such as small brain chips that are integrated into our daily lives based on where they can tell us our wellness, they can, you know, basically, just help us throughout our daily lives with small little tasks and give us diagnoses. And it's important that people don't just sit back and fall behind in a rapidly changing world, it's important to look at it and start to be proactive thinking towards what it's going to be. So that's one of the reasons I think it is most important for people to experience our project and start to envision what life they will be living in 2040.\n\n__Sofia Stout 2:15__\nDefinitely. So you've already shared some insights. But maybe what are some other insights or ideas you've gained from this project?\n\n__Phillip Loges 2:22__\nYes, so majority of the insights I've gained around the ideas of a massive demographic shift, and a very digital future. So by 2040, there's gonna be a huge change in demographic, the work world is going to look different. There's going to be so much more diversity inclusion throughout the entire world. I believe the white population will no longer be the majority in the world as a major demographic change that we'll see. And as well as coming out of COVID, with everything going online, people saying that you can work from home, you can do everything digitally, we see a more digital style of work, and people are going to start realizing you can do more with the technology that you have than what you're already doing.\n\n__Sofia Stout 3:16__\nAbsolutely. So last question, what are you personally doing to prepare for the future?\n\n__Phillip Loges 3:22__\nPersonally, I am being proactive in educating myself. I'm watching and listening to TED talks and podcasts and watching videos, going on to different news sites to see what's going on in the world right now, what's coming out, not just looking at one specific news outlet, but I'm going to international news outlets. Because oftentimes, just the national, you know, domestic news outlets aren't telling you everything else that's going on the world. So it's an important thing I think other people should also do is branch out and try and figure out what else is happening in this world. Don't wait till the information comes to you. I'm going to the information and finding it for myself.\n\n__Sofia Stout 4:05__\nAwesome. Yeah. Thank you so much. We're looking forward to when your project launches!\n\n__Phillip Loges 4:10__\nThank you!"

I'm a junior chemical engineering major in cohort nine and as she said, our project is about envisioning 2040.\\n\\n__Sofia Stout 0:26__\\nYeah. So what can you tell us about the project? And why is it important?\\n\\n__Phillip Loges 0:30__\\nSo our project, Envision 2040, is about thinking ahead and being more proactive toward your future, specifically, more than next 20 years. And it's important because many people don't really realize how much change we're seeing in short periods of time. And our technological advancements are growing at an exponential rate now and a world is even seeing them demographic shifts. So it's important for people to keep up with those times. And if you look back at it, people are now holding supercomputers that are better than what NASA sent people to the moon on and they're holding those in their pockets. And these people are seeing these changes in those people alive right now that had car phones, which nobody really knows what they are anymore. So we're seeing advancements like never before. And specifically, my topic in our project is about what kind of future tech we will see integrated into our daily lives. And we're focusing on Elon Musk's neural link a little bit. And soon we'll be seeing technologies such as small brain chips that are integrated into our daily lives based on where they can tell us our wellness, they can, you know, basically, just help us throughout our daily lives with small little tasks and give us diagnoses. And it's important that people don't just sit back and fall behind in a rapidly changing world, it's important to look at it and start to be proactive thinking towards what it's going to be. So that's one of the reasons I think it is most important for people to experience our project and start to envision what life they will be living in 2040.\\n\\n__Sofia Stout 2:15__\\nDefinitely. So you've already shared some insights. But maybe what are some other insights or ideas you've gained from this project?\\n\\n__Phillip Loges 2:22__\\nYes, so majority of the insights I've gained around the ideas of a massive demographic shift, and a very digital future. So by 2040, there's gonna be a huge change in demographic, the work world is going to look different. There's going to be so much more diversity inclusion throughout the entire world. I believe the white population will no longer be the majority in the world as a major demographic change that we'll see. And as well as coming out of COVID, with everything going online, people saying that you can work from home, you can do everything digitally, we see a more digital style of work, and people are going to start realizing you can do more with the technology that you have than what you're already doing.\\n\\n__Sofia Stout 3:16__\\nAbsolutely. So last question, what are you personally doing to prepare for the future?\\n\\n__Phillip Loges 3:22__\\nPersonally, I am being proactive in educating myself. I'm watching and listening to TED talks and podcasts and watching videos, going on to different news sites to see what's going on in the world right now, what's coming out, not just looking at one specific news outlet, but I'm going to international news outlets. Because oftentimes, just the national, you know, domestic news outlets aren't telling you everything else that's going on the world. So it's an important thing I think other people should also do is branch out and try and figure out what else is happening in this world. Don't wait till the information comes to you. I'm going to the information and finding it for myself.\\n\\n__Sofia Stout 4:05__\\nAwesome. Yeah. Thank you so much. We're looking forward to when your project launches!\\n\\n__Phillip Loges 4:10__\\nThank you!\"},\"linkedIn\":{\"en-US\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-loges/\"}}}"

I am Zainab Soumahoro. I'm part of Lockheed Insitution cohort 10. This is Rachel Duke. She's part of cohort nine. I'm just going to ask a few questions about Envision 2040, the project that her and cohort is working on. And also how are you, Rachel?\n\n__Rachel Duke 0:27__\nI'm good. How are you?\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 0:29__\nI'm good as well. That's great to hear. So the first question I'm going to ask you is why is the Envision 2040 project important?\n\n__Rachel Duke 0:37__\nI think that the Envision 2040 project is super important because it's something that we're all going to live. It's something that people who are already in industry are going to live, we're going to, we're going to see how this world changes over the next 20 years. And it's really, really important for us to prepare for that, to know how to be flexible, and how to adapt to the changes that are going to happen in the next 20 years because we're all going to be a part of it and we're all going to experience it in the workplace.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:01__\nVery nice answer! Very good answer! Okay, so the next question I'm going to ask you is, what insights have you gotten in exploring this topic?\n\n__Rachel Duke 1:13__\nIn exploring this topic, I've gained some insights, I've done a lot of research on allyship and how to be a really good ally, and how everyone can be an ally, you don't have to be a person of power or privilege in order to be an ally, you can be an ally to anyone in any situation. And also just the idea that so much is going to change in the next 20 years that like we can't even really comprehend it. Some of the changes are going to be so drastic that we would never think that they're possible today. But they will be like, if we look back 20 years ago, we probably didn't think some of the things possible today are but then they happened. So yeah, keep an open mind. And to think of that, those are some of the biggest insights I've had.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:50__\nWow! Those are nice insights, very eye-opening. So the last question I'm going to ask you is, what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\n\n__Rachel Duke 2:03__\nIn order to prepare for the future, I think I'm going to personally keep a really open mind, work to do a lot of like embracing different changes. Making sure that you're flexible and adapting as time goes on and not, you know, staying stuck in one mindset, it's important to like, grow in our mindset, and to continue to learn and to continue to better yourself throughout the changes, especially because the changes in the next 20 years, they're going to be so much bigger than in the last 20 years. And it's just going to be a totally different world. So it's important to be flexible and adaptable.\n\n__Zainab Soumahoro 2:36__\nOkay, thank you so much, Rachel. That was very nice answers. I hope your guys' project goes well, and everything turns out you know, even though obviously right now a bit hectic, struggle is like, you know, a hassle and stuff like that. So I hope everything comes out well! Thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to answer some of my questions.\n\n__Rachel Duke 2:29__\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you."

I am Zainab Soumahoro. I'm part of Lockheed Insitution cohort 10. This is Rachel Duke. She's part of cohort nine. I'm just going to ask a few questions about Envision 2040, the project that her and cohort is working on. And also how are you, Rachel?\\n\\n__Rachel Duke 0:27__\\nI'm good. How are you?\\n\\n__Zainab Soumahoro 0:29__\\nI'm good as well. That's great to hear. So the first question I'm going to ask you is why is the Envision 2040 project important?\\n\\n__Rachel Duke 0:37__\\nI think that the Envision 2040 project is super important because it's something that we're all going to live. It's something that people who are already in industry are going to live, we're going to, we're going to see how this world changes over the next 20 years. And it's really, really important for us to prepare for that, to know how to be flexible, and how to adapt to the changes that are going to happen in the next 20 years because we're all going to be a part of it and we're all going to experience it in the workplace.\\n\\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:01__\\nVery nice answer! Very good answer! Okay, so the next question I'm going to ask you is, what insights have you gotten in exploring this topic?\\n\\n__Rachel Duke 1:13__\\nIn exploring this topic, I've gained some insights, I've done a lot of research on allyship and how to be a really good ally, and how everyone can be an ally, you don't have to be a person of power or privilege in order to be an ally, you can be an ally to anyone in any situation. And also just the idea that so much is going to change in the next 20 years that like we can't even really comprehend it. Some of the changes are going to be so drastic that we would never think that they're possible today. But they will be like, if we look back 20 years ago, we probably didn't think some of the things possible today are but then they happened. So yeah, keep an open mind. And to think of that, those are some of the biggest insights I've had.\\n\\n__Zainab Soumahoro 1:50__\\nWow! Those are nice insights, very eye-opening. So the last question I'm going to ask you is, what are you going to do to prepare for the future?\\n\\n__Rachel Duke 2:03__\\nIn order to prepare for the future, I think I'm going to personally keep a really open mind, work to do a lot of like embracing different changes. Making sure that you're flexible and adapting as time goes on and not, you know, staying stuck in one mindset, it's important to like, grow in our mindset, and to continue to learn and to continue to better yourself throughout the changes, especially because the changes in the next 20 years, they're going to be so much bigger than in the last 20 years. And it's just going to be a totally different world. So it's important to be flexible and adaptable.\\n\\n__Zainab Soumahoro 2:36__\\nOkay, thank you so much, Rachel. That was very nice answers. I hope your guys' project goes well, and everything turns out you know, even though obviously right now a bit hectic, struggle is like, you know, a hassle and stuff like that. So I hope everything comes out well! Thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to answer some of my questions.\\n\\n__Rachel Duke 2:29__\\nYeah, absolutely. Thank you.\"},\"linkedIn\":{\"en-US\":\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-duke-9766ab192/\"}}}"
