Access to the internet, which is where for most job applications the only way to apply, rely on people paying for their internet services. Schools are incorporating more and more technology into the classrooms, like laptops and tablets, and having readings and homework solely online. [[3, 7]](#references)\n\nThis isn’t some new phenomenon due to Covid-19, as early as 2012 [[6]](#references) there are notes on how it’s not just online only job applications, but an online social presence that many can’t afford. Things like networking on LinkedIn can give applicants a significant advantage that those without regular internet access can’t get. In 2011 62% of 1,055 presidents of colleges and universities used online textbooks.[[11]](#references) For some lucky college students they find themselves elibible to request and recieve financial aid, though most are currently only available due to Covid-19 such as the [Emergancy Broadband Benefit](https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit). [[4,5, 12]](#references) There were even bills introduced, not passed, in House in 2019 2020 to help keep the internet accessible for the public.[[13, 14, 15]](#references) \n\nThere are organizations such as the [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/publications/) that work to bridge that gap through providing technology training, publishing papers, and getting involved in policy writing. \n\n![National Digital Inclusion Alliance Infographic](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/2dyRTT4wRxJGs5gtgC8YP7/d33d4445f2520844145f83b6db8118f4/NDIA-infographic-scaled.jpg)\n\nThis leads into the overlap concerning how important having the funds to access technologies with those physical and mental disabilities needing further technology or aids to access other aspects of life on top of that. Further increased by the issue that not everyone can afford the technology they need to accommodate their disability. Things like closed captions are becoming more common but you can probably think of at least a dozen YouTube videos with extremely inaccurate ones, there’s at least one entire channel dedicated to it. Alt text is also fairly commonly mentioned, but not implemented everywhere. Entrance ramps that are far out of the way. In summary, a lack of available options. \n\n__\"Accessible  ICT can level the playing field for persons with  disabilities  across  life  domains  including  education,  employment,  e-governance  and  civic participation, financial inclusion, and disaster management.\" - Deepti Samant Raja__ [6](#references)\n\nTeam meetings are meant to be a time to hash out problems and come up with solutions, but how inclusive are you being? Can everyone contribute? Are you understanding everyone? Can everyone understand you? [[1]](#references)\n\nIt takes effort to put in the necessary work and learn the skills to be inclusive and create an inclusive workspace. Doing that now makes a long term difference in the lives of everyone can benefit from being able to access what are regularly considered common resources.  \n\n### How to be Inclusive and Encourage that Inclusion\n\nWhen it comes to the workplace and instilling the practice of an inclusive environment for people with disabilities, different forms of communication are one way to achieve it. If we specifically reflect on the different types of meetings held within companies and schools for example, from the overall administrative team to the teams of smaller organizations or peer groups within the institute, we can begin to see some of the ways in which we can increase inclusivity. \n\nThe United Nations’ ESCAP [[1]](#references) wrote a document that sheds some light on how to have more disability-inclusive meetings. As an important foundation for constructing solutions as we dive in to some insights from ESCAP and others, let us reiterate what the actual issue is: that people with disabilities face a barrier(s) such that it will require some creative and considerate thinking from all involved persons in the organization to help their participation in meetings to be more effective and almost seamless. \n\nAt times, it seems like “one-size fits all” solution, but it is encouraged that one take these insights as a way to be able to construct a solution of one’s own according to unique scenarios. [[1]](#references) A critical next step is to reflect on ourselves as individuals. What have we personally done in meetings with these persons, whether brief or long, to be simply considerate or help accelerate the needed accommodations, so the focus can be on the topic being discussed? Can we truly say we are working as a team to increase the company or school’s success when we have issues from within the structure such disability-inclusivity that we are seemingly timid in addressing? In the  big picture, if we do not allow for our environment to be one that is truly striving toward inclusivity, can we truly say that we’re nearing our highest potential as an organization?\n\nTo encourage more accessible environments, it is important to recognize that some disabilities may not be as visible, so while it is easy to say that the meeting room will have the proper equipment to accommodate those who use wheelchairs for example, what are some more specialized and indicative ways that accessibility can be instilled? When we consider what the UNESCAP’s document says are four critical areas of accessibility:The physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open to the public [[1]](#references). What are some of the areas that may need some more attention? \n\n## Why We Care\nFrom our everyday lives to the workplace, there is not a place where technology does not often influence us especially in the US. Ensuring and reinforcing accessible technologies such as with the internet, videos, and the various digital tools involved to operate them, allows for victories over barriers and walls that prevent people with disabilities from reaching their fullest capabilities and from participating in a valuable way to society [[9]](#references). Innovative thinking is being lost and hidden in the shadows of our inability to see possibilities of looking past ourselves, especially if we are able-bodied. Despite how far we have come in understanding people, and though there are laws in place to promote this topic, from a sociological standpoint, it seems as though we, as a society, made it a norm to show some deviance in seeing it as enough to implement an obvious accessible technology for the sake of the law and turn a blind eye to what more could be done. It will not only be to the advantage of people with disabilities to avidly uphold the accessibility standards set by the government through the ADA laws but also to us as it means a chance to collaborate with more diverse groups and add to our knowledge in order to advance society for the better [[9]](#references). According to Baker’s “Making Technology Accessible to Everyone,” one in four adults experience a disability and about 70% of users discontinue using a website that is difficult to navigate [[10]](#references). More consideration towards this subject would hopefully decrease the attitude of ritualism that also tends to be a side effect of the process of providing aid to people with disabilities. \n\n![inclusivemeeting](//images.ctfassets.net/keiomil1rdyy/4Oak9f7MMtmnbnbDYr3Wep/7ca372e062fbf552754ce88eb55d16a3/inclusivemeeting.png)\n\n## Takeaways\n- The accessible technology may be available, but how much time is spent talking about them versus taking the steps to have them implemented and used in a routine manner as needed? \n- The circumstances of a disability vary. What are we doing now to ready ourselves for unexpected circumstances that might force as to revisit the idea of inclusivity and being able to play a role in society despite the timid attitude toward the subject.\n- To reiterate, how far have we come in increasing accessibility for as many     people as possible and how much farther could we go?\n\n## Further Reading\n- [Kat Boogaard's *How to Make Your Workplace More Accessbile to People With Disabilites*](https://www.themuse.com/advice/how-to-create-an-accessible-workplace)\n- [TeachAccess](https://teachaccess.org/about/faq/)\n- [Assistive Technology Solutions](https://atsolutions.org)\n- [*Lack of Internet Access Has Become Critical for Students*](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alabama/articles/2020-09-19/lack-of-internet-access-has-become-critical-for-students)\n- [United States Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Arkansas%20internet&g=0400000US05&tid=ACSST1Y2018.S2801&hidePreview=true) \n- [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/10/28/5-leading-concerns-about-the-future-of-digital-life/) \n\n<a name=\"references\"/></a>\n## References\n- [[1] United Nations ESCAP's *Disability Inclusive Meetings: An Operational Guide*](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Disability%20Inclusive%20Meetings%20PDF.pdf)\n- [[2] Suman Damera's *Tips for Creating an Accessible Workplace*](https://www.deque.com/blog/tips-for-creating-an-accessible-workplace/)\n- [[3] Emily Tate's *Covid-19 has Widened the 'Homework Gap' Into a Full-Fledged Learning Gap*](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-06-16-covid-19-has-widened-the-homework-gap-into-a-full-fledged-learning-gap)\n- [[4] Patrick Roney's *Students concerned with lack of internet access, job security in light of online transition* ](https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2020/03/students-concerned-with-lack-of-internet-access-job-security-in-light-of-online-transition)\n- [[5] National Digital Inclusion Alliance](https://www.digitalinclusion.org/about-ndia/)\n- [[6] Deepti Samanta Raja's *Bridging the Disability Divide through Digital Technologies* for the World Bank Group](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/123481461249337484/WDR16-BP-Bridging-the-Disability-Divide-through-Digital-Technology-RAJA.pdf)\n- [[7] U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/oii-news/use-technology-teaching-and-learning/)\n- [[8] Mark Lieberman's *Technology Can Address Digital Accessibility -- to an Extent*](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2018/05/02/technology-can-help-address-accessibility-challenges-many-say)\n- [[9] Accessible Technology in the Workplace](https://accessibletech.org/accessible-technology/)\n- [[10] Bekah Baker's *Making Technology Accessible to Everyone*](https://medium.com/cratebind/making-technology-accessible-to-everyone-1606d9746a51)\n- [[11] Pew Research Center, Kim Parker and Amanda Lenhart's *The Digital Revolution and Higher Education*](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/08/28/the-digital-revolution-and-higher-education/)\n- [[12] National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017098/index.asp) \n- [[13] Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/4131)\n- [[14] Supporting Connectivity for Higher Education Students in Need Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3701/related-bills) \n- [[15] Community Broadband Act of 2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2785)"

I really enjoy solving difficult problems and I hope that software will allow me to find solutions to these problems. I believe that in the future software will continue to drive many industries and the technology will grow in scale. I was driven to join the institute because I want to be better prepared to be a leader in my field.\n\nOn campus I am member of the Scholars program and participate in research related to blockchain technology. Additionally, I love to spend time outdoors hiking and I am involved with the sailing team. I also helped to create a chapter of my fraternity Kappa Sigma at Miami University.

My name is Asia Flores, and I am part of Cohort X of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. We have been working hard these past few months on our upcoming conference: #Reimagine Collaboration: Navigating the Evolving Workplace. I am excited to share some of the key takeaways from Washington Post’s recent webinar titled Future of Work: Collaboration & The New Job Market with Jared Spataro & Heather Boushey. As you can tell from the title, this webinar was broken up into two parts, which is how I will be structuring my discussion of the webinar today.\n\nFirst, Jared Spataro, who is the Corporate Vice President of Modern Work at Microsoft, came on to talk about what has been called the “Hybrid Paradox”, which is a term that has been used to describe worker’s simultaneous desire to maintain the flexibility that they were given in the workplace during the pandemic while also expressing a desire to engage in more in-person collaboration. So obviously, these things seem kind of mutually exclusive.\n\nMr. Spataro says that one key aspect of addressing this paradox is how we define the word “hybrid” itself. For Microsoft, they look at hybrid working as not simply just flexibility in the location in which you work, but also the times you work and even how you work. To address these key needs of workers, Microsoft has decided to implement a 50% in-person reintegration to the workplace. So, workers must come into the office at least 50% of the time, but for the other 50%, they may work in any capacity they choose without needing to notify their manager. So they have complete control over the remote aspect of their jobs. And the reason Microsoft decided upon this model is because, according to their Work Trend Index study of over 31 countries, 30,000 people, 73% hoped to have jobs where employers allowed them to maintain the flexibility they had during the pandemic, but at the same time, 67% of them wanted more in-person collaboration. \n\nWhen it comes to logistics in terms of what it will look like when employees do come into the workplace, Mr. Spataro said that those sorts of decisions will be pushed as far down as possible, most likely to the Corporate VIce President Level, as there is variation in the kinds of work different employees are doing that will affect what in-person models will make the most sense. Some common examples that have been used at Microsoft include neighborhood seating, which include an assigned workspace that you come to when you work in-person, and others include a hotel-type system where you sign up for an available space on the days you wish to go into work.\n\nNext, they talked a little bit more about the changing expectations of workers as a result of the pandemic. As I’m sure everyone can relate to, a lot of people ended up spending a lot more time working over the pandemic because it wasn’t totally clear when the workday started and ended. There wasn’t that commute time that sort of separates our professional lives from our personal lives, and a lot of people had a hard time “shutting off” their work. Workers actually ended up spending 150% more time in meetings, and about 30% of them said that they felt completely exhausted from work. So, people are definitely feeling burnt out in the aftermath of this pandemic. To combat this, Microsoft has implemented a new application called “Insights” that tracks wellbeing, burnout, making sure that employees are getting enough time to speak with their manager, etc. and they’re hoping this will help them to monitor employee’s maintenance of that ever-important work-life balance.\nIn addition to this, Jared equates the pre-pandemic worker as running on a treadmill where they don’t control the incline or the speed, but both of which are being increased by their employer without their input. At the height of the pandemic, when everything was fully remote, people were given a chance to slow down and reflect about what they truly wanted. Coming out of this time of self reflection, it was found that 41% of employees were planning to leave their current employer within the next 12 months and 46% of employees wanted to move house, so a geographical relocation. And these numbers are both much higher than we have seen in the past. So clearly, this nationwide trend that we’re seeing of labor shortages is connected to people’s reevaluation of what they desire from their professional lives.\n\nAs for the future of technology, Mr. Spataro mentioned that he believes that the next step after companies adopt the hybrid model in the workplace will be the merging of digital spaces with physical spaces, so things like the establishment of holograms and a metaverse and things of that nature. While it seems a little out there, it is definitely possible in the near future and the  data that Microsoft has collected when pilot testing their new program, Viva, shows that people will prefer an avatar over a camera when interacting with others virtually. \nSo, there are definitely some big changes coming to the workplace as a result of the pandemic, which has totally sped up the process of digital transformation like we never thought possible.\n\nNow, for the second part of this discussion, I will be overviewing the key insights from White House Economic Council Advisor Heather Boushey. Ms. Boushey did mention that there has been an average of 600,000 jobs gained per month since President Biden took office and that the unemployment rate is again below 5%, so overall, the country is trending toward economic recovery again. She noted that a key aspect of getting workers back into the workplace and to recovering the economy is that we reach our target vaccination rates so that consumers feel safe participating in their usual activities again, and workers feel safe returning to the workplace, and this is an idea that has been unanimously agreed upon by economists.\n\n Ms. Boushey also mentioned that benefits for workers such as paid parental leave, access to affordable, quality care for children, the elderly, and disabled individuals will play a large role in empowering people to participate in the workforce, particularly women, who typically are expected to take on this role of caretaker. And lastly, when asked about what has been termed “The Great Resignation”, referring to the large number of workers who have left their jobs in the aftermath of the pandemic, she attributes this to workers feeling they have more options to choose from in regards to their professional careers, and tying in what Jared Spataro had to say, businesses that better adapt to a hybrid workplace model and make flexibility and mental health a priority for their employees will be strongly favored by workplace talent for years to come.\n\nSo there, you have it! Hopefully you learned something about the evolving landscape of the workplace and the future of the labor market, I know I did! Thank you for watching and stay tuned for more from Cohort X and our #Reimagine Collaboration Conference!\n\n## Bio\nI am from Orland Park, IL, a suburb about 30 minutes south of Chicago. I am majoring in bioengineering with minors in electrical engineering and neuroscience.\n\nI decided to major in engineering because I love the idea of being able to apply what I’ve learned in school to solve real issues and make a positive impact on the world and the people around me. I chose bioengineering and my minors with the goal in mind that I would like to develop better medicinal and therapeutic treatments to treat mental illnesses and neurological disorders. These areas of study will empower me to think critically about how to apply learned concepts to develop solutions to hardships faced by people on a daily basis, and this opportunity to improves the lives of others is what makes me happy to be an engineer. I was inspired to join the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute because I believe that engineering goes beyond technical knowledge and requires you to be creative, think on your feet, and collaborate well with others, and this organization equips you with the soft skills needed in order to be an effective and impactful leader. I look forward to developing as a leader throughout by time with the institute and applying my learnings throughout my various roles on campus.\n\nSince I started at Miami University in 2019, I have been heavily involved with Engineers Without Borders. I was excited by the opportunity to be hands-on in developing projects that make a positive impact on others. Being involved in this organization has taught me greatly about the importance of being educated on and respectful of other cultures and how to effectively collaborate with others. I am excited to continue to develop my role as leader in the organization. I have also been a part of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Team here at Miami since August 2020. Since then, I have been working with other students, faculty, and staff to identify measurable ways to improve our campus and make it an inclusive place for everyone. I look forward to seeing our progress as time goes on. I also enjoy being a part of the Grand Challenge Scholars program, LSAMP, and the Honors college at the university as these programs allow me to collaborate with others and push myself to improve as an individual."

In this book, Patel uses a combination of corporate research and personal anecdotes to provide clarity on the issues of diversity, inclusion, and wellness at work. It provides a revolutionary perspective on maintaining an inclusive lens as companies adapt to the future of the workplace. \n\nHer main focus revolved around the concept of the distributed workplace. A distributed workplace is one that goes beyond the situation of going remote in a crisis, and fully takes advantage of the technological advancements involved, so as to open up the workplace to more opportunities. A remote work environment allows companies to hire from anywhere and allows employees to work from anywhere. It also provides a prime opportunity for employers to check their hiring processes for bias. Patel describes the positive effects that this could have on employee diversity and inclusion. Many people have close ties with their location, which can have connections to their culture and identity. By opening up to distributed workplaces, many will be able to obtain exciting new positions without having to sacrifice the local community that they identify with. It offers more choice to employees struggling to balance career aspirations with cultural roots. I feel that this is summed up very well in Patel's words, that remote work allows us to embrace people where they are for who they are. However, like many things distributed work will be a balancing act. \n\nThe second half of the book addresses inclusion and wellness. Employees should feel able to bring this culture and these identities based on where they live into the workplace with them, especially virtually, it's pointless to open up job possibilities to the best and the brightest. If they don't feel comfortable being their true selves at work. The benefits of fostering diversity are lost if people don't feel welcome sharing their backgrounds and opinions, and the cost of hiding parts of themselves will drive many away, increasing turnover rates and decreasing productivity. Studies have shown that one of the most important criteria in a job for human capital retention is genuine connections with others, so companies to need to develop strategies in order to provide this for their employees in a distributed workplace setting for it to work. It distributed workplace has the potential to get a wider range of people into the door. But corporate systems and strategies have to be put in place so that they can then flourish. \n\nPatel concludes with a series of checks and recommendations for employees and employers to discern whether they are effectively being inclusive in a distributed setting. This includes points such as advocates, and policies being put in place to ensure recruiting and hiring of underrepresented groups. It also includes making sure programs go beyond mentoring, and encompass connecting and advocating for others. These ideas are mostly geared towards the wider company network, but I found a lot of them to be adaptable to my everyday life. Going forward, I'll be sure to check in with myself and the people around me to ensure that we are encouraging people to express new ideas, celebrating our differences, and calling out bias when we see it. All these are tangible takeaways from Patel's book that can and must be utilized when building a distributed workplace.\n\n## Bio\nI am from Kalamazoo, Michigan, where I graduated from Comstock High School and the Kalamazoo Area Math and Science Center. No matter how far away I travel in the future, Kalamazoo will always be my home. It holds the memories of all of the amazing teachers, mentors, and family members who encouraged and inspired me. These people helped shape my goals, passions, and leadership style, and I’m excited to continue growing and learning from the people around me.\n\nOne particularly significant contribution from Kalamazoo was the proximity to biomedical and pharmaceutical corporations, which helped to ignite my interest in chemical engineering and helped me understand my career path. Engineering has always been a very people-oriented field for me: helping people, solving problems, and working on a team to accomplish something bigger than yourself. I can’t wait to create my own impact in the industry, and hopefully inspire students the way engineers have always inspired me.\n\nIn addition to the Lockheed Martin Leadership Cohort, I am also deeply involved in the university Honors College, serving on the student advisory board and in a variety of program lead capacities. I’ve greatly enjoyed my role as a peer mentor to freshman, getting the chance to help them build connections and introduce them to college life. I also hold a position as student laboratory aide in Hughes Laboratory on campus, working in the stock room and prepping student labs."

My name is Sophia Staudt. I am a member of Cohort X of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. \n\nOn March 11th of 2022, Cohort X is excited to be hosting a conference surrounding our theme of Reimagine Collaboration: Navigating the Evolving Workplace, where we will share our insights into the present and future states of how organizations, employers, employees, and customers work together. As part of our research into this topic, I read the book The Future of Work: The Insights You Need from Harvard Business Review.\n\nIn view of COVID-19, social justice movements, and digital transformation, The Future of Work considers how the new dealing forged between employers and employees will be redefined along a series of three dimensions. These three dimensions calls for organizations that wish to thrive in this new age of working to have a shared purpose surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; radical flexibility in interacting with employees who exert greater control of where, when, and how they work; and deeper connections as employers who support not only the work experience but the life experience of employees.\n\nThe Future of Work is comprised of nine different articles divided into four sections titled respectively “The Authentic, Anywhere Office,” “The New Workforce,” “Redefining the Inclusive Organization,” and “The Purpose-Driven Organization.”\n\nThe section “The New Workforce” surprised me the most. In this segment of the book, we are made to reconsider who or what makes up our workforce, even discussing how organizations can properly onboard artificial intelligence. I was most intrigured by the article “Rethinking the On-Demand Workforce” by Joseph Fuller, Manjari Raman, Allison Bailey, and Nithya Vaduganathan. This piece looks at how organizations are more greatly considering employing the talents of freelance or gig workers. In their survey of nearly 700 US businesses that use these workers, 90% of the leaders they surveyed believe these talent platforms, like Upwork and Kaggle, will be central to their ability to compete in the future.\n\nWhen I first entered college, I never considered remote work as something I would do. This past summer, however, I had my very first software engineering internship that was completely virtual. As I read “Rethinking the On-Demand Workforce,” I realized that similar to how companies and individuals like myself maybe had not seriously considered themselves as being a part of remote or hybrid work now we are beginning to recognize the opportunity that is this specialized on-demand talent.  \nIf you are interested in checking out in more detail what the future of work entails, I would highly recommend this book. I also recommend that you stay tuned to see what Cohort X of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute has to share in our conference this spring.\n\n## Bio\nI am from Marietta, Ohio, the first permanent settlement in the Northwest Territory featured in David McCullough’s *The Pioneers*. Growing up in a historic city, I developed an appreciation for history and learning about where we come from. My latest lifetime project is completing Will and Ariel Durant’s 11-volume set of The Story of Civilization that I began this past year.\n\nAs for choosing the computer science field, I have always been drawn to problem-solving. My favorite video game growing up was the Professor Layton series for the Nintendo DS Lite that involves solving various puzzles. In school math has always been one of my favorite subjects. Coming to Miami I thought my personality and interests fit well with studying computer science. Since my first introductory programming class, I fell in love with programming. I could not imagine myself in any other field.\n\nMy passion for self-improvement drove me to the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. While my computer science classes teach me the hard, technical skills I need as a future software engineer, the Institute teaches me how I can navigate this growing field in industry when interacting with others within my team, as well as with other professionals across departments and industries.\n\nOutside of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, I am also involved with the University Honors Program and the College of Engineering and Computing Women’s Mentorship Program."

Reed and Joseph A. Allen. \n\nThis is a very useful and informative book that can be used as a practical guide to help businesses and employees discover ways to make virtual meetings and work in general easier and more effective. \n\nThe book is littered with tools designed to help employees “adopt and adapt” ways to conduct business virtually. They include checklists, try this sections, case studies, chapter takeaways, and reflection activities. All of these tools were honestly very useful to me as I was reading this book because they allowed me to understand new learning points that I could apply in my own life. \n\nThis book provided many key insights, to include best practices for meetings before covid, best practices for meetings after covid, opportunities and challenges of virtual meetings, and what’s next in the virtual meeting world. \n\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, it forced every country to change how people were living. The pandemic shut down the economy, schools, restaurants, and many businesses. \n\nOnly essential workers who worked for identified essential businesses, such as grocery stores, farms, and medical care, were allowed to continue going to work in person. But for all other types of work, employees were forced to work fully online. \n\nBefore the pandemic, organizations dabbled in work from home ideas but many workers were denied flexible work schedules at home. But once Covid-19 hit, everyone was forced to work virtually from home. This meant people no longer had to commute to work and only had to open up a laptop to participate in a work meeting. However, working from home had a few negative outcomes, such as working longer hours because employees were already at home. On average, employees worked an extra three hours every day. Additionally, employees no longer had the opportunity to see people in person and were overwhelmed with the distractions of home life, while also trying to concentrate on work. \n\nEighty percent of meetings were in person before the pandemic with only four percent held over video. After the pandemic, video meetings jumped to sixty percent. This drastic change to virtual digital meetings has changed the workforce completely. Many professions are referencing that even after the pandemic is over, they are considering continuing to use virtual meetings as their primary means for meeting. All of the digital technologies that are being used because of covid-19 will continue to be a major influence on the new workplace, even though we could probably go back to normal accessibility after the pandemic. Video call technologies such as Zoom have been the pathway that people have gravitated towards so that they could have professional and personal connections with those that they used to be in contact with before the pandemic. Video cameras were around before the pandemic but may not have been as essential as they are during the pandemic. Without them, people may not have had a way to stay connected with others. \n\nOther key insights that I gained from the book were tips to help make virtual meetings more interactive and effective. The first tip is to turn on your camera. Many people in large group video calls (or many video calls no matter the size) normally do not turn on their cameras but it is critical that people keep them on. If an employee turns off their camera during a video call or meeting, they can become more distracted because they may try to multitask, which would hamper the effectiveness of the meeting. If an employee keeps their camera on, they would be less likely to divide their attention on something else because others in the meeting may notice. \n\nAnother tip I learned was to keep your microphone on mute. Keeping your microphone on mute helps diminish background noise around you that may not be noticeable to you but may be noticeable to others on the call. Another valuable tip was the use of the chat function in larger groups. Chat lets an employee communicate with individuals or groups of individuals without disrupting the person who is speaking. But when using this tool, be careful to not let it distract you from paying attention to the person who is speaking and purpose of the meeting. \n\nThe fourth tip I thought was very important was to build in time for social interaction. This is a very important point because the lack of social interaction can create feelings of isolation on both work accomplishment and human connection. Many people derive meaning from the relationships that they have with others at work. To combat these feeling of loneliness and isolation, employees should make sure to schedule time to be able to interact with other employees. These times do not have to involve work and can help relieve stress and form a sense of togetherness. \n\nThis book provides so many great tips to help make remote meetings more efficient and successful. I highly recommend it to anyone that is considering virtual work or is currently working virtually to read it to help make themselves and their workplaces more productive and enjoyable.\n\n## Bio\nI am a military dependent and have had 9 military moves throughout my life. I have lived in Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Washington D.C., Ohio, Stuttgart Germany, New Mexico, Hawaii, and Virginia. People have often asked me which place was my favorite and I’ve always had a difficult time answering that question because I have a very special place in my heart for all of those places. Each and every place I have lived has helped shape me into the person I am today. I am blessed to have amazing, loving parents who have always been there for me and have taught me so much. They inspired me to pursue my dreams, the importance of service to others and living life to the fullest.\n\nEver since I was a little kid, I’ve had a passion for making things. When I was 2 years old, I received my first Lego set and that ignited my love for building. As a toddler I would go to the grocery store with my parents and I would find useless nick-knacks on a shelf or on the floor and morph those objects into toys or jewelry and give them to my parents as gifts. I am majoring in mechanical engineering because it will provide me with the opportunity to do two things I love, creating and helping people. That passion also led me to joining the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute because it is a program designed to strengthen leadership skills and the ability to utilize those skills to help make the world a better place.\n\nMiami has been a great place for me to pursue my dreams. On campus, I am involved with several programs and clubs. In addition to the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, I am a member of the Miami University Club Swim Team, the LSAMP program, the S.T.E.M. Club, the University Academic Scholars Program, and the CRU Christian Fellowship Organization. I am so excited and blessed to be a part of Cohort X and am looking forward to taking our journey together."

I’m majoring in computer science and software engineering here at Miami, while also pursuing a certificate in creativity / entrepreneurship.\n\nEver since I was a kid, programming a robot for the first time or learning HTML at a summer camp, I loved computers and what I could do with them. I tried out other engineering fields in high school, but I really liked the degree of flexibility offered in computer science. I was limited only by my imagination and ability to find the information needed to bring whatever idea I had to fruition. By the time I got to college, I knew I wanted to major in computer science and software engineering.\n\nI heard about the institute during one of my visits to Miami and was very interested in the deeper transformation and reflective experience that it offers. I joined the institute so that I would be able to reflect more deeply on leadership, while learning from and contributing to a close-knit community of people who were also interested in becoming better leaders and versions of themselves.\n\nI spend most of my free time working as a technology consultant for World Creativity & Innovation Week / Day, where I find ways to showcase all the amazing creative celebrations that people have around the world every year, via the website (wciw.org). When I’m not coding, I also enjoy solving Rubik’s cubes, rock climbing, figure skating, practicing martial arts, and drawing / painting."

I am junior computer science with a minor in humanitarian computing and engineering. I am a cohort x member and during this video I will telling about my key insights with the research I did on our big project which is reimagining collaboration. Now, for my research I decided to listen to 5 podcast which were focused on diversity, inclusion, culture, and technology, I felt doing this to hear the real feelings of people who is witnessing these things. With the podcasts I listened to I tired to listen to things that will change in the future such as technology, culture, diversity, and inclusion. \n\nNow from the podcasts I listen to that was focus on technology, while listening I realized Covid put a big change on the way we will possibly work in the future. We seeing now new technology and programming to help people to do things virtually. Something that I also think that related  to our cohort project research and something we talked about that effects of people who works labor related jobs, and those jobs probably won’t be around in any future time and take over by machines. Some else the related technology podcasts pointed out to me that something my cohort didn’t talk about was jobs taking over be A.I such as Human Resources position. I thought things would very interesting and it made me questioning, how can we a society help those who will lose their jobs to A.I and other machinery? \n\nNow, With the podcasts I listen to that was focused on diversity, inclusion, and culture.  Out of the three podcasts that I listened to I learned that the culture within the company virtual or not virtual effects the way employee work. With diversity, inclusion, and culture; something that was very key insight with these podcasts was the effects on employees mentally healthy and that effects the way they work. Our cohort brought this up in conversation when we was talking about diversity and how that would look within our project and I think with the conversation with listening to the podcast that a lot um during covid that mental health strucked during the whole covid and going virtual and everything and within culture effects the way employee work as well and that something that a lot of podcasts the podcast talking about and a lot of the people who ever that they were interviewing how the culture effects they way people works and say with they are going to work there and if there not going to work there and it was very insightful as a society and as we grow we are going to be a little bit more picky about current things that we want. Now, With my research about diversity, inclusion, and culture, I knew that this conversation and the change will not end but to continue to change. Diversity and Inclusion isn’t just based on race and gender but it’s more than that and as we as a Society grow diversity and inclusion as well. Thank you for listening to my video and have a nice day.\n\n## Bio\nMy name is Morghan and I am majoring in computer science with a minor in humanitarian computing and engineering. I am from Shaker Heights, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland and I am an alumnus of Shaker Heights High School.\n\nAs a child, I never knew what I wanted to be when I grew up until I joined a programming club in middle school. I enjoyed learning how to program in web design languages. In this club, I was also introduced to women that looked like me and were in S.T.E.M (science, technology, engineering, and math) related fields. In high school, I joined the National Society of Black Engineers Junior where I learned about the stories of other people who looked like me. Being involved in these programs gave me the motivation to get my degree in computer science because I wanted to inspire and motivate others. I chose my minor because I wanted the opportunity to learn other things so that I am able to use those skills and my technical background to solve real world problems and keep an open mind.\n\nI was interested in the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute because I felt as though it would expand the way I think. In the past, I witnessed different people who were leaders, and I wondered if there was a right way to be a leader. My involvement in the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute has made me excited for the future and extended my knowledge about being a leader. Outside of the Institute, I am involved in several student organizations. These include the National Society of Black Engineers, Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, Gradu8, and Bridges. Recently, I joined Engineers Without Borders and the Society of Women Engineers."

          "en-US": "I am a Mechanical Engineering major from the Cleveland, Ohio area. I have always had a strong desire to know how machines work. Early in high school, I came to the realization that all the old appliances and televisions I dismantled as a kid were leading me toward a career in engineering. The more I delved into STEM curriculum, the more I wanted to build, explore, and learn. I chose Mechanical Engineering because it combines elements of mathematics and physics that play to my academic strengths, but it also challenges me to be a creative problem-solver.\n\nAlthough I am building technical and analytical skills in the classroom and lab, I believe it is important for me to have strong understanding of the business world because I will interface with co-workers with non-engineering backgrounds. Along with taking coursework in the business school, I am immersing myself in campus organizations that introduce me to professional business practices, while allowing me to develop an executive presence that will be critical for my success as an engineer.\n\nThe Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute’s commitment to transformational leadership is perfect because it allows each cohort member to develop a plan for personal and professional growth in a collaborative environment. I am already learning so much about how strong leaders utilize their emotional intelligence to embrace change, think strategically, and motivate others. As Cohort X continues to grow into a cohesive group of leaders, it will be great to see how we influence each other and the College of Engineering and Computing."

Work Disrupted is written by Jeff Schwartz and discusses the accelerated future of work with respect to opportunity, resilience, and growth. \n\nIn the very beginning of this book the author clarifies what he means by a disruption. “When we think of a disruption, we generally think of a disturbance that interrupts. In business theory, a disruptive innovation is one that creates a new market, shaking up the existing market, and displacing it. Disruptive innovation is a powerful way to think about innovation-driven growth”. This offers a different insight into the title. We can take this concept and think about all the growth that is to come, rather than what we are leaving behind. The pandemic has forced us as a society to grow quicker than we thought possible, moving to remote work for nearly a year, with hybrid work becoming the new normal. Jeff Schwartz offers some tips and tricks to help prepare for this future of work that we are entering. \n\nThere are three sections in the final part of this book, each offering seven mindset shifts for different groups of people. They are the individuals, the business leaders, and lastly the citizens and communities. Each of the mindset shifts are accompanied by some action items to help the reader begin to implement these shifts into their daily lives. \n\nTaking a deeper look at the individual, here are some mindsets I am trying to implement in my daily life. The first shift takes a look at growth versus fixed mindsets and how to develop or work on having a growth mindset. One of the action items is, quote “To cultivate a growth mindset, keep learning. Take on new challenges and if you can, new experiences”. Luckily for me, being a junior in college, I am learning something new every day. I feel that I do need to work on not having a fixed mindset, so when I am learning, I will embrace the setbacks and move forward, learning from them and knowing that this is natural on the path to growth. \n\nAnother shift focuses on being a team player rather than a solo player. This mindset became evident during the pandemic and remote work. It has become increasingly clear that good work comes from a diverse group of people with different ideas. Connection and contribution are necessary for this good work to occur. Some action items for this shift are to quote “build connections with colleagues”, both socially and professionally, and “develop your personal capabilities to effectively lead, participate, and support the teams you’re part of.” Social media like LinkedIn and Twitter are a great way to connect with people. I am working on expanding my connections and putting myself out there, both professionally and socially. The Leadership Institute is helping me grow my skills as a leader and a team player. I will continue to work on these as it is clear that are important for a successful future. \n\nOne last shift that I will discuss is the fifth shift: “Nurture Capabilities to Be an Explorer by Leveraging your Curiosity and Love of Learning.” As we grow as a society, so does our technology. So how do we compete? The key is not to compete but rather work with this technology, but also to foster emotional and social capabilities that machines do not have. There is a difference between skills and capabilities. “Skills are very context specific...What we’re talking about are capabilities that are helpful in any environment, that are context independent.” One capability that is talked about a lot is curiosity, which often gets crushed due to monotony or repetition. Some action items for this mindset shift include: “Develop and invest in your own enduring human capabilities as your foundation: curiosity, imagination, creativity, empathy, problem solving, teaming, and social intelligence”. The goal is to then use these capabilities to help better your skillset. I would like to work on my problem-solving capabilities as well as my imagination for seeing what is not right in front of me. The world is evolving, and I would like to evolve with it, so I must make myself competitive for this new future of work. \n\n## Bio\nMy name is Catherine Avart and I am from Oakton, Virginia, right outside Washington, D.C. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering with the hopes of working towards eco-friendly living and sustainable technologies.\n\nI was not certain about engineering until my senior year in high school when I was taking calculus and loved it. I was so intrigued by the problem solving and the new material that I decided to look at engineering and what that would mean for my future. Coming to Miami, I instantly knew that I would find what I was passionate about and allow myself to dive deeper into my studies. I was drawn to the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute for many reasons, the main one being their call for preparing students for the real world. The soft skills that Lockheed focuses on are not taught in a standard classroom and will help prepare me for the future. With a timeline on the issue of climate change, I knew that I wanted to graduate as a strong individual who was ready to contribute in any way.\n"

Over several years, Buckingham and Goodall visited various companies ranging in size and notability to explore the most common miscommunications and myths about the workplace. There were three specific lies that pertain to the future of collaboration, those three being: people care which company they work for, the best people are well-rounded, and work-life balance matters most. \n\nTo elaborate, Buckingham and Goodall’s research indicates that people don't actually care very much about the company that they work for. They care more about the team that they work on, as that is where they will see the biggest impact of their work. The company’s vision will hardly impact employees' day to day lives compared to the effect that each employees’ department or team will have. The future of the workplaces will likely see a large focus on teamwork, rather than company wide group work.\n\nSecondly, the book explains that the best people are not well rounded, but in fact are “spikey”. While an employee might be more experienced in various fields, an employee that has a refined skill set and can focus great and efficient work on a few fields is more valuable to a team. An effective leader will understand their team members strengths and utilize each member on projects that fit their respective skills. Meanwhile, a team member that is decent at many skills, will not be as easy to organize onto a specific project and will be less likely to be effective in their work.\n\nFinally, Buckingham and Goodall state that a work life balance is not the most important rule in work, but rather a love-in-work balance is most important. It behooves both the employee and the company to find a strong connection between the employees’ interest and the work they do. An employee can have a perfect work life balance, spend an appropriate amount of time doing work and leave plenty of time to explore interests outside of work, but they will burn out quickly and not produce quality products if they don't enjoy what they are doing. \n\nI found the insights from the “Nine Lies About Work” to be very interesting and helpful in hypothesising where the direction of the workplace is headed and what collaboration may look like in the future. I hope you found this video interesting and learned something about the future of collaboration.\n\n## Bio\nHello! My name is Charlie Clark and I am a second year student at Miami University studying Mechanical Engineering. I grew up in Seattle, WA and moved to Thousand Oaks, CA in high school. I am a huge outdoor enthusiast and I will always want to go camping, backpacking, or even just hang out in a hammock.\n\nI chose engineering because I am passionate about building things and problem solving. Growing up, I loved playing with Legos and anything I could take apart and put back together. I challenged myself to make my models and Lego projects better than the original when I put them back together. Problem solving excites me and encourages me to keep working, especially when I am in a group or team. I joined the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute because I wanted to improve my group and teamwork capabilities in addition to improving my leadership skills. I have experience working and leading teams from my journey to Eagle Scout and other organizations, but I always see areas where I could improve those skills.\n\nOn campus, I am a campus tour guide, the president of the Outdoor Adventure Club, a member of Engineers Without Borders, and a member of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. I am also frequently hanging around in a hammock around campus."

To learn more about how the pandemic has changed the way we work and the way we view work, I’ve read two papers. The first one titled “the effects of remote work on collaboration among information workers,\" published in Nature Human Behavior was a study completed using data from over 60,000 Microsoft employees in the United States. The researchers found that although the number of collaborators for individual employees did not change, the number of distinct business groups employees interacted with decreased. This means that employees spend more time within their groups strengthening existing bonds while each group becomes more distant from each other. Generally, individual collaboration networks become more static, churning bonds decreased and added connections decreased meaning that employees are not accessing as much new information about other parts of the organization compared to in person work. \n\nThis study also looked into the methods of communication and found that the difference between remote and in person collaboration is in how we collaborate, not how much we collaborate. The number of scheduled meetings decreased and the number of unscheduled calles increased, meaning that synchronous collaboration as a whole decreased. This resulted in a high volume of emails and instant messages. Since methods like emails are less rich than audio or video calls, researchers are concerned about communicating complex information in less rich formats. While the paper had some limitations, the overall recommendation for businesses was not to make any permanent plans without long term data. \n\nThe second paper I read was conducted through Poly, which is a global communications company focusing on audio and video tools for collaboration. They conducted a study in Europe and the Middle East about the evolution of the workplace. They stress that in order to recruit and retain young talent, employers need to give greater autonomy to their employees. 69% of respondents said they believe the traditional 9-5 job is dead, although Poly warns not to confuse the new “anytime” working with “all the time” working. They also found that proximity bias is a serious concern for employees with the majority feeling that remote workers will miss out on learning opportunities from leaders, be overlooked for career development, and face general discrimination. Although this report focused on what companies should do to attract and maintain employees, they stress the need for compromise between both groups. This leads to the question: What can I do to prepare myself for this future of work? I’m working on changing my mindset. I like to plan ahead and get frustrated when things don’t go to plan, so I’m working to embrace change. I’m working on accepting uncertainty and thinking on my feet to make sure that I’ll be able to change directions and make decisions quickly. Hopefully, as I get more practice, this will stop being reactive and become a habit.\n## Bio\nI’m a Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Physics student from Mason, Ohio. In elementary school, I dressed up as Neil Armstrong for a project about influential Ohioans because I loved space. As a kid, I admired his accomplishments in space exploration, but I have since grown to respect his humility and passion for teaching. Engineering and physics are both relevant to understanding the universe beyond Earth, and the combination provides answers to why phenomena occur and how to apply them in a useful manner. While I still love learning about space, I have also developed an interest in engineering design research and engineering education.\n\nI was interested in the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute because of its highly personal and nontraditional approach to teaching leadership. So far, I’ve learned a lot about myself and how to improve and grow as both a leader and a person. The Institute has provided resources and opportunities to apply and practice the skills that we discussed in class. I want to continue collaborating and learning from other members and cultivating skills needed for success in the workplace.\n\nOutside of the Institute, I’m a member of Engineers Without Borders, Society of Women Engineers, and Theta Tau. I am currently a part of EWB’s Rwanda Sanitation project, which focuses on improving the general waste system and latrines at a school. It has been incredibly rewarding to make progress towards solving global issues using my engineering skills. I am also a tutor at Rinella Learning Center, and it has been fulfilling to help students set and achieve their learning goals and feel successful."

This book is designed to give CEO’s advice and information on how to transition to a remote company structure. However, I found that it also offered great insight into how I, as a future member of the work force, can better succeed in the new world of work. \n\nThe authors stress the importance of creating a people first business model. That is the approach they have both taken in their own businesses and attribute a lot of their success to that principle. Culture and people emphasis is even more important during virtual work. They have found that when you hire passionate people they will be driven by the common mission, and you won’t need to micromanage them. People who do well in remote model approach their career as if it were a company and they were the CEO. They are motivated to excel and ongoingly develop their skills. In fact, the authors believe that when designing a new virtual business model, the sequence should be people, process, tools and technology. They argue that when the people and processes are not set, the tools and technology can make the existing problems worse. \n\nTo plan the optimal remote model for your company, the authors say that you should think of it as a process of visualizing your optimal organization and then painting it on a virtual canvas. They emphasize that the design stage should be very deliberate, their maxim being design what you want or deal with what you get. When transitioning, you need to identify and bring the strengths you have in person into the virtual model. It is very important that the brick-and-mortar strengths are translated into the virtual layout. The authors also emphasize that a remote model is much more malleable and agile than most brick-and-mortar models and allows for constant revision. This can be very useful for company leaders who are trying to optimize how their organizations’ function. \n\nThe authors championed an idea called the Swiss Cheese Model, which emphasizes the need to look at the holes in the organization. This means looking at what is missing from staff, finances, operations, projects, culture and then figuring out how to fill in the gaps. COVID made seeing these gaps and cracks a lot easier. The authors recommend making data collection and analysis an integral part of the operational framework by using short weekly surveys or a project management system. The authors described the system they use, PDW, Performance Driven Workforce, which created an index score out of performance metrics and employees projects and pay were impacted by their score.  These metrics are important because while brick-and-mortar companies focus on the inputs, virtual work companies focus on output. This is useful to CEO’s who are concerned they will no longer be able to monitor productivity when they go virtual. \n\nStudies have shown that employees invest more time in work when they work from home. Away from the office, there is less noise and fewer politics. It makes it easier for people to think, “Sure, why not?”. This frees up employee’s time to focus on core work. Jory MacKay (2020) found that remote workers spend 4% more time on core work and 18% less time on communication than office workers. This translates to 58 more hours on core work and 256 fewer hours on communication. A lot of this is due to less time and energy spent making many mundane decisions. At your home office, you can go on autopilot, diminish decision fatigue, and save the gas for the big decisions. Determining what makes people the most productive is a difficult task, but a Google study which investigated team effectiveness found that it mainly depends on team members taking risks, the personal importance of the work to the team members, and the belief that the work will make an impact.\n\nThe authors believe that remote work compels us to focus on human nature, as well as group and individual strengths, and while it may be a complicated transition, for many companies it is well worth it. They emphasize the importance of having a people first business model, designing deliberately, and translating your strengths. \n\nThe most important key takeaways for me, as someone who will be entering the workforce soon, was to approach my potentially remote/hybrid career as if I am the CEO of my work. This will empower me to take responsibility for my own results as well as continually develop my skills and abilities. It will also be important for me to focus on my outputs as that is what is more effectively measured in hybrid work environments. I will work on focusing on and making time for core work, that is important to the company’s overall mission, rather than on day-to-day routine tasks. Overall, this book gave me some great perspective into the world of virtual work and how I may succeed in it. \n\n## Bio\nI am from Dublin, Ohio and attended Dublin Coffman High School. I decided on chemical engineering as my major due to my interest in chemistry in high school as well as my family’s encouragement to pursue a STEM major. I knew I wanted to major in a subject that was challenging and impactful.\n\nI joined the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute to further develop myself professionally and to gain important Leadership skills. I wanted to learn ways to improve my emotional intelligence and gain insight into how to best interact with those around me on teams and projects. I am grateful for having these opportunities to grow and to take myself to the next level.\n\nOn campus I am involved in various clubs and activities. I am a member of Theta Tau and served as the Fundraising chair and on the Professional Development Committee. I have also worked on multiple grants for Engineers Without Borders. I am a member of Tau Beta Pi and work as Undergraduate Research Assistant on campus. Additionally, I have performed with the University Orchestra as a flutist.\n"

I’m a member of Cohort X of the Lockheed Martin Leadership institute at Miami University, and my cohort and I are working on this project Reimagining Collaboration where we discuss the future of the workplace. \n\nSo I read and analyzed the book Making Work Human by Eric Mosley and Derek Irvine who put together a novel discussing how it is becoming more apparent than ever the importance of maintaining and incorporating positive workplace relationships. They discuss these interactions and how they promote quality work, relationships, and company loyalty. Not only does this promote customer satisfaction, but the authors discuss the positive impact of an employee that has a sense of belonging and allows them to grow alongside their company instead of growing out of their company. \n\nIn terms of our project, understanding the benefits of a human-centered workplace is critical in having a deeper appreciation for the importance of collaboration. And also, particularly in a hybrid workplace, the way that we have had those interactions in the past will change and will continue to change, probably very quickly, in the next few decades, and it's important to understand how having a human-center workplace could be an advantage for companies and something that I hope I will be able to bring into my everyday interactions and career. \n\nSo, Eric Mosley and Derek Irvine discuss the emphasis of the employee experience in addition to the customer experience, whereas first it’s always been kind of prioritizing the customer. The authors discuss how if you have an employee that feels appreciated and heard, it can really strongly benefit the company in terms of the happiness of their customers, as if your employees are satisfied then therefore your customers will be to. They discuss that, with a new economy comes a new way of treating employees, they place emphasis on social media platforms and how prevalent they are in today’s society, that it is easier than ever to write a review on a company as a customer or an employee and how these can have really strong impacts on your interactions with other employees and customers. For example, if an employee writes a bad review on your company, a customer that would go see that review may not even want to work as a customer, with your company. We also have seen that there is an emergence for a desire for autonomy in employees and emphasis on competitiveness, efficiency, traditionalism prior, has now resorted to a desire for more flexibility, a very hands-off approach that allows employees to work when and where they feel like it, with more lax dress codes and other company policies that before may have been very strict. It is more appealing to employees to have that flexibility, and one of the biggest points of emphasis that Mosley and Irvine address is the need to then replace those interactions and have those interactions, and one of the methods they discuss is the need for social recognition, and there are actually electronic platforms that they believe acn make this much more feasible and tangible in the workplace, and they believe that when you have employees that feel appreciated and that sense of belonging to the company can make them more resilient and adaptive to the fast-paced environment that our workplace has become. They also address the changes of culture that happen in the workplace when employees feel appreciated, including greater effort and better relationships. \n\nIn terms of how I could incorporate this into my life, I have the great advantage of getting to be an employee and a worker in 2023, 2024 and really seeing how that takes place from that side of things, so that give or take 5 or 10 years when I begin to emerge into leadership roles, I will be better equipped for that collaboration with, keeping things that I have learned about human-centered workplace and human-centered design in mind. They also present social recognition tools as a method for how to help employers know how to not only reward their employees but also for employees to be able to communicate to their employers how they would like to be recognized and rewarded, if you will. New innovations in technology can be used to help employees appreciate each other and appreciate their superiors and vice versa, but also to communicate clearly and collaborate with their coworkers. Employers are advised to couple this with tangible rewards that are separate from their paid compensation, their paychecks, beyond that transactional relationship as this will demonstrate effort and appreciation from the employers and will also add to that sense of belonging that Mosley and Irvine discussed prior. This information is critical in understanding how current events shape our workplace, and how this will impact collaboration in the long-run. As a student who is entering the workforce, it is more important than ever for me to understand how I not only can advocate for myself but also for, down the road, when I am a leader, how I can advocate for my employees, how I can advocate for the people that I am working alongside. The workplace is increasingly fast-paced, quick to change, quick to move, and the importance of it is to recognize human emotions and how you can move with it in order to better adapt for change.\n\n## Bio\nI am from Columbia, Maryland, a small suburb between Baltimore and D.C. I graduated from Atholton High School in 2019 in the top 10% of my class and was lucky enough to be a member of the Atholton’s volleyball program, bringing home 2 state championship trophies during my time there. My passion for computer programming started around this time, and I found myself enthralled by the satisfaction of developing working software, fixing bugs, and problem solving.\n\nIn addition to my major in Computer Science, I also have a minor in Management through the Farmer School of Business. I am super passionate about software development and the project work that goes into it, but I really felt that a business-related minor would allow me to better learn how to communicate and work effectively with people, another one of my passions. Developing these soft skills has been pivotal in my studies at Miami, and I truly feel that Lockheed is able to fully take the insights I have learned and apply them to real-world issues. I applied for the Leadership Institute because I wanted to not only round myself out, but also felt compelled by the mission of this program, as well as the idea of getting to work alongside other engineering majors to make this happen.\n\nBesides being a member of Cohort X, I am also an active member of Chi Omega, a sorority on campus. Within this organization, I serve as the Senior Committee chair, focusing on organization involvement."

I’m Jacqueline and I’m a member of Cohort 10 of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute.  Next March, Louise M. Morman and all members of Cohort 10 will be hosting and presenting Reimagine Collaboration, a conference which seeks to analyze and interpret the new remote work environment that we have seen surface since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.  \n\nWhile learning more about how I can Reimagine Collaboration and navigate the evolving workplace, I was lucky enough to read The New Future of Work, research from Microsoft into the Pandemic’s Impact on Work Practices.\n\nIn this report, authors Jamie Teevan, Brent Hecht, Sonia Jaffe, and many others dive into how COVID-19 caused technological, social, and cultural disruption amongst our society over the past year.  The report specifically focuses on remote work and how collaboration and meetings, personal productivity and well-being, software engineering experiences, IT and security, and devices and physical ecosystems have all changed and what implications this switch has made on our society as a whole.\n\nMicrosoft, which I’m sure you have all heard of, is a large American technology corporation that produces computer software, consumer electronics, and personal computers.  Since their mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, Microsoft took immediate action to understand the work environment transition that is currently underway and how we can ensure this new way of work is as effective, safe, and successful as possible.  Through research, coordinate efforts, and over 50 projects, Microsoft was able to identify both positive and negative impacts of the remote work environment and offer solutions and ideas for people to consider as digital spaces become a part of the workplace norm.  \n\nAll of their time and research has allowed us, Cohort 10 of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, further understand what changes have been made since the transformation of the workplace and how we can ensure this new environment is as inclusive, accessible, engaging, and advanced as possible.  Some ways we may achieve these goals include prioritizing accessibility tools such as captions, ensuring employees have access to the same technology, engaging all individuals through meaningful conversations, and emphasizing the importance of secure internet access while working from home.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more ways we can successfully create and improve remote work environments, we invite you to attend the Reimagine Collaboration conference on March 11th, 2022 at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  In the meantime, check out our website and social media for information, ideas, and solutions that we will be releasing over the next few months.  Thank you so much for watching and we hope to see you in March!\n\n## Bio\nHi! I’m Jacqueline McCully, I am an Emerging Technology in Business and Design major from Columbus, Ohio. From the moment I was introduced to Adobe Photoshop in high school, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology and design that would allow me to be both artistic and innovative.\n\nAs a student at Miami University, I am able to express my creativity through student organizations such as our school fashion publication, UP Magazine, and my sorority, Kappa Alpha Theta. Within these groups, I am given the opportunity to work with a variety of individuals to create and finalize projects that recruit and inspire others.\n\nIn an everchanging world, we see advancements being made in all aspects of our lives. The Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute allows students to better understand how we can become effective leaders and guide others through these changes. I am beyond happy to be a part of this program and to learn more about how I am able to enhance my own leadership abilities before entering the workforce and facing the unpredictable future."

I’m a junior who's majoring in Software Engineering and a minor in Business Analytics. I will be graduating from Miami University in 2023, and my preferred pronouns are he/him/his.\n\nGetting into college, I had an ideal that I want to influence the world and contribute to it, and one of the strongest mediums through which I can influence change in today’s world is Software Engineering. That and having a mind for analysis led me to Software Engineering and a minor in Business Analytics. Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute’s goals and ideals drove me to apply for the leadership institute, so that I could grow and work with some of the smartest minds at the College of Engineering and Computing, and learn more about leadership.\n\nOver the past couple of years, I have worked and grew through leadership positions that Miami University has to offer. Along with being a part of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, I’m also a Resident Assistant at Withrow. Over the past semester, I was an Undergraduate Associate for the CEC101 through which I interacted and worked with graduating batch of 2024 and smoothen their transition to campus. I’m also the Social Media Head for ‘Coding Wizards’, a CEC organization that organizes hackathons and coding competitions at Miami University."

With over 1200 employees across both the US and India, English has learned how to develop his firm’s culture in a workplace with minimal face to face interaction among employees, and shares these techniques in “Office Optional.” He describes the necessary components of a successful remote organization, with a large focus on the implementation of collaborative tools, and the building of trust between coworkers and leadership within an organization. \n\nThe first major topic covered in Office Optional is how to develop and display trust in employees who work remotely, as a foundation of trust is necessary when developing a company culture. A common misconception that English points out is the belief that remote employees are less productive than their physical, in office counterparts. However, the reality of the situation is that remote workers tend to work too much due to the challenge of separating work life and personal life when working in a remote setting. To address this, English explains how the structure of a work day for remote employees should not just mimic that of a traditional employee in an office setting. Within his own company, he instead minimizes any concrete rules for remote workers, and encourages employees to take breaks as needed, and gives them the autonomy to do so as they wish. This mentality shows a shift from a traditional workday setting to a culture that is designed for remote employees. \n\nAfter establishing the importance of trust in a remote setting, English moves on to the methods necessary to then build a sense of community among employees who do not all work in the same setting and rarely see each other in person. English gives an example of this within Centric Consulting, where company culture began to dwindle as they scaled up in size. Due to this, it’s imperative that leadership takes the initiative to build a company culture as soon as possible, with examples of this being culture development programs for new employees. Additionally, the lack of a physical work space removes a majority of regular human interaction among coworkers, making the building of strong interpersonal relationships exceedingly difficult without any initiative from leadership. English emphasizes the value of these relationships, which have been proven to increase productivity even in remote environments, and recommends organizing meetings to have more time scheduled than necessary, so that the remaining time can be spent socializing among coworkers, providing an avenue for human interaction that is otherwise lost in remote environments.\n\nLastly, in order to facilitate the building of strong relationships among coworkers, English illustrates the importance of high quality collaborative tools. The lack of the necessary collaborative tools can make interpersonal interactions feel like a chore, killing company culture instead of building it; By providing your organization with a suite of collaborative tools, the social disparities between in person and remote work will be minimized, allowing for the creation of a remote company culture that is just as strong as a traditional workplace setting.\n\n## Bio\n\nI am from Summit, New Jersey, a medium sized suburb about 45 minutes outside of New York City. My lifelong interests in math and science naturally made me wish to pursue engineering ever since middle school. I chose to major in mechanical engineering due to its hands on, team-based structure.\n\nWhile the courses I take here at Miami are fantastic at developing technical and problem-solving skills, engineering is about more than just crunching numbers. It is also about generating new ideas, thinking outside the box, and knowing how to be a member of a team. This is why I joined the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute. Through the institute I get the opportunity to learn more about myself and others while also developing important professional skills to prepare me for the workforce.\n\nOutside of the Leadership Institute I am also a member of Miami’s club ultimate frisbee team The Miami Boogiemen, where we regularly travel to compete in tournaments against other universities."

Today, I want to talk about my research for our Cohort 10 project Reimagination Collaboration, where our Cohort discusses the changes in the Hybrid workplace. \n\nFor My research, I read the book “Human Work: In the Age of Smart Machines by Lumina Foundation CEO Jamie Merisotis”(merry-sotas).  In this book, Jamie talks about the future of the workforce and the elements that need to be changed to be ready for the  continuous growth of technology such as Artificial intelligence  or AI. \n\nThe book first talks about the speed of technological growth within the past century starting from the first industrial revolution to the current work environment during covid. In the history that was covered , during the economic recessions jobs were lost and gained. However, in the recent economic recessions the jobs that were created during new economic growth were not the same as the jobs that existed for lower skilled and blue collared workers \n\nAccording to a 2019 study by Georgetown university center on education and the workforce , From Dec 2007 to January 2010 7.4 million jobs were lost in the US, with 5.6 million of those jobs being lost from High school degrees or less education credential workers.\nThis study also saw during the growth of the economy before the pandemic up to 2020, 8 million jobs were added but only 80,000 of those jobs came back for workers with high school degrees or less.\n\n This brought up the issue of technology hurting job expansion. As the author explained, more effort is needed to create growth of skills that are uniquely characteristic to humans. Jobs, no matter how advanced,  such as surgeons and lawyers, have the potential to be replaced by new technology such as AI if they just relied on the  simply repetitive application of advanced skills. \n\nTo prevent the growing disparities of the marketplace  “human work”  is needed to be expanded and grown. This so-called human work requires people skills which involve  (communication and team working skills such as empathy with coworkers) problem solving skills, and integrative learning and application skills necessary for the competitive workforce to create new solutions for innovative challenges in the world. \n\nThe next part of the book talked about “wide learning” which encompasses the learning process throughout the person's life unlike training which prepares workers for scenarios but restricts them to a selected thinking process that will curtail their creative thinking process. One of the key points of this section of the book involved reaching beyond a certain point and applying a wide range  of knowledge acquired through life to reach a person’s full range of capabilities. To do this, a higher standard of learning is needed, especially that develops human skills that will not be replaced by technology. \n\nThis was suggested by the author by creation nationally transparent standards areas and credentials that clearly define the skills workers possess  in the workforce, the investevent of talent using companies and educators to target all potential workers and not just those from traditional backgrounds  and finally changing the  attitude held towards work itself to a carefully maintained balance between personal fulfillment and service to society. \n\nFurthermore,To personally develop my own human work and wide learning skills, I will open myself to new ideas by exploring new hobbies and meeting new people. I will also Expand my active citizenship in society  and voluteuner for various non profits like Habitat for humanity to develop empathy and team working skills. Finally I will “own my own learning”  by making sure I  fully understand the skills and knowledge I acquire, so that I can integrate it into my problem solving skills.\n\n In conclusion, by creating a mindset that we should not try to compete with AI or fear its growth in our society, but  instead should look at this new and constant technological growth as collaborative tools that can be used alongside human work skills,  our society will be able to solve any challenge we encounter in the future. Thank You!\n\n## Bio\nHi, I’m Raymond Pugh. I am from Canal Winchester, Ohio.\n\nAs a kid in elementary school, I always had a fascination for science. This manifested itself in middle school in which I participated in an extracurricular club called Science Olympiad. This extracurricular activity held competitions that tested participants knowledge over topics in science and had them build devices for various challenges. The process of designing and building devices for these challenges made me realize my love for engineering. During high school football, the head coach had us do activities with servant leadership to help better the team as well as the community around us. This motivated me to seek leadership roles such as NHS in high school and now Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute here at Miami. As a member of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute, I hope to develop my teamwork and communicational skills to foster a better working environment for my future career as a mechanical engineer.\n\nSome other organizations I am apart of include Engineering and Computing Student Council (ECSC), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), Habitat for Humanity, and the Sneak Geeks Club. In ECSC I am currently the Organizational Board Director and in NSBE I am one of the Miami Chapter senators."

I consider these two aspects to be the most important aspects of my life and try to incorporate them in as many ways as possible in my life. In my free-time I enjoy skateboarding, playing the guitar, and listening to music.\n\nI chose Engineering Management as my major, primarily due to my course experiences my freshman year. After having taken primarily mechanical engineering courses my first year at Miami combined with a few business classes, I realized how much I enjoyed the combination of both disciplines. From there I looked into Miami’s Engineering Management degree and was impressed with the quantity of both disciplines’ courses under the degree program and quickly switched over.\n\nOn campus I serve as treasurer of the Miami University Men’s Glee Club, and PR Director of the Men’s Glee Club’s subsidiary a Capella group, The Cheezies. As singing has always been an integral part of my upbringing and enjoyment, I was very excited to participate in vocal ensembles here at Miami. Both groups have brought me immense joy, and I look forward to continuing my involvement with them for the next two years."

I am about Lockheed Martin Leadership Institution Cohort 10. I am majoring in mechanical engineering with a minor in paper and humanitarian engineering from Cincinnati, Ohio, and today I'll be talking about a book\n I read, called the teacher of the office by Peter Capelli, and basically he talks about how working from your office working from home is not the new thing, but it's something that going to be new and companies, as we all know the pandemic had made a\n\n a lot of us, or encouraged a lot of us, as I like to put it, to step out of our comfort zone into things that you normally wouldn't do so within this book he talks about how companies are going to have to like, adjust to how employees want to work.\n\n There's a chapter in a book How employees, how the pandemic.\n\nHow the pandemic impacted them with them working from having to have to work from home, and how a lot of the employees actually enjoy working from home, and a lot of other employees prefer to work from the office.\n\nSo something that many companies that he mentioned in the book is like, it's an opportunity. It's an opportunity that companies must take is there's an opportunity for companies to take basically to, if they're, if you're in a process of like re-programming,\n03:25:45 or re- branding your company to be more inclusive, with your employees. This is one of the ways to do it, having the option to work from home or work in the office place.\n\nSo basically, with reading this book and help me relate a lot back to what my cohort is doing with the collaboration, and how having a hybrid work environment with within companies is very crucial important and very inclusive\n\nas well. And there's something that's something that we really want to highlight in our conference, and within our project that will be launching in March.\n\nand yeah, and what one of the main points I got out from reading the book is basically that come it, the pandemic has encouraged, like, a lot of companies to step out of their comfort zone, and like you have to adjust.\n\n03:26:56 And with that adjustment comes a lot of new things, new ideas, new ways to do certain things, stuff that you would never have done before, basically.\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nSo with the Hybrid workplace.\n\nIt's just, it's going to be the new normal. Basically, and that's something, I believe Cappeli trying to get at with in his book is like it's going to be something that's going to be the new normal, basically.\n\nSo, and that's something that our conference and resembles a lot, how it's time to recognize the fact that most people don't like just to work at the office, what people like to work at home.\n\nWorking at home is more convenient for most people, stuff like that yeah and that all I have to say\nThank you so much for listening to what I have to say\nAnd I hope you all have a wonderful day\n\n## Bio\nI am born in Cincinnati, OH but my family is from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. I spent most of my childhood in different part of the United States. For example, New York, Indiana and Pennsylvania. A majority of my family is from Abidjan, so I do not see them as often as other people. My mom had all girls, and I am the oldest of the four. In conclusion, I basically raised my sisters. If you are the oldest, you know what I mean. My parents are immigrants; that makes me the first person to go to college ever. Which can create a lot of pressure, but I tend to handle pressure well sometimes. I try to set a good example to my sisters and inspire them to go after what they want to do.\n\nWhat drove me to become a mechanical engineer was the fact that I was good and loved math. I also wanted to help people, but I didn’t want to be a doctor, a lawyer or a social worker. So, far while I didn’t know what I wanted to major in college and then I saw a commercial about engineer. The commercial talked about how engineering is more to it than computers and airplanes. It was funny because I believe that all they did until I saw that commercial. Engineers can help people and improve people live just by trading this simple new technology. So, because of that commercial that I saw it really open my eye towards the major and career of being a mechanical engineer. Then I also realize there’s a lack of women and particularly black women in the STEM field. Going into this field with dominated by white males it can be very difficult to speak up and talk about your thoughts and how you feel and how you want to leave. Which is why I believe Lockheed Martin leadership institution would be perfect for me to have a much better understanding on how to be a leader in any type of dynamic that I’m placed in. I personally feel like he Martin leadership Institute you get more than just leadership skills and gain connection you gain communication skills and you just email know I personally feel like that he Martin leadership institution you get more than just leadership skills you gain communication skill; team build skill and so on.\n\nI am currently the National Society of Black Engineers Public Relation Chair. My position jobs are to maintain and present our chapter on multiple society media platform in a reasonable manner. I get to connect with different alumni, put out content that my co-chair had created. It really fun and refreshing from constantly doing schoolwork."

Working from home virtually has become a new norm. Yet as Simon explains in his book, collaborating virtually is difficult and quite often isn’t done successfully. During the pandemic, we have witnessed the rise of collaboration hubs like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom.\n\nSimon defines collaboration hubs as a general use software application designed to promote effective communication and collaboration. Ideally, all organizational conversations, decisions, documents, and institutional knowledge exist in a hub. \n\nToday's collaboration hubs are more versatile, powerful, affordable, and user-friendly than ever before. Yet few companies are taking advantage of what these tools can do. \n\nToday's collaboration hubs offer an effective place for knowledge management and provide efficient search tools to find documents. For example, Slack is a hub that is actually an acronym that stands for searchable log of all communication and knowledge. Hubs make finding knowledge simpler.\n\nCollaboration also becomes more accessible with hubs, since you no longer need a laptop to work, offering portability. Hubs also have more robust and customizable notification systems. Hubs offer automation, and through automating tasks employees save more time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic didn’t start the trend of adopting collaboration hubs like these and others, it accelerated it.\n\nToday we see companies are embracing virtual work, and the importance of utilizing these collaboration hubs is already and only going to further increase in the future.\n\nAs you can see, hubs are extremely powerful and beneficial to collaboration, but with the integration of spokes there will be a tremendous improvement of employee, group, and organization communication and collaboration.\n\nSpokes are software applications designed for a specific purpose like productivity, content creation, customer relationship management, and project management. Spokes can easily be integrated to exchange information from hubs, provide status updates, and more.  \n\nToday you and I use lots of different applications and systems daily to get work done, and we need different applications for different purposes.\n\nSo you can see why spokes are beneficial. \n\nSimon provides a new and more holistic model of work based on hubs and spokes, which he calls the Hub-spoke model.\n\nAn example of the hub-spoke model that Simon mentions is Zoom's announcement of Zapps, which is an array of third-party applications that Zoom will soon host on their application. In this, you can see that Zoom is the hub that connects the spokes. \n\nThis is a model that we all need to adopt into our collaboration toolbox. \nOne thing I plan to do and you can as well is to figure out how to best utilize the hub-spoke model to maximize productivity, collaboration, and communication with others. \nIntegrating critical applications to hubs is simple to do and can be done no matter technical expertise.\n\nKnowing this I plan to explore what spokes would help me the most to increase my productivity, create content, manage projects, and more. I plan to get more out of today's collaboration tech and prepare myself for the future of work through collaboration hubs.\n\nIf you found this video interesting, I would definitely recommend you reading this book.\n\nThank you for watching this video, and stay tuned for more content and information on reimagining collaboration.\n\n## Bio\nMy name is Michael Amoah and I am a Computer Engineering major from Bronx, New York. I was born in the Gambia and came to the US when I was five years old. When I was younger I would constantly take things apart to understand how they worked, and then try to put them back together. Not only did this curiosity get me into trouble when I couldn’t succeed in reconstructing what I took apart, but it also sparked my passion for problem-solving. In high school, I was fortunate enough to have been a part of a program that took my classmates and I, out of the classroom and exposed us to the various branches of engineering. It was there that I realized how the world of technology is constantly progressing and I wanted to be a part of the teams that are leading society towards a better future.\n\nSince then my goal has been to create life-changing advancements to help those in need. I am looking to work in the semiconductor industry, for leading companies such as Intel, Samsung, Texas Instrument, and Nvidia. The semiconductor industry is responsible for most of the essential technology that we use such as most electronic devices, that allow us to communicate, compute, transport, interact, and offers many other applications.\n\nI never imagined that I would end up at Miami University, getting the opportunity to further my studies and pursue my passions. I joined the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute to learn how I can develop my personal, professional, and strategic thinking skills. I wanted to gain skills that could help me produce more value in society than the knowledge that we get from the average college course or university studies. I was also intrigued by the opportunity to work with a diverse group of minds. I am grateful to be a member of Cohort X and can’t wait to see what this journey has in store for us. On campus I am an Evans Scholar, involved in the National Society for Black Engineers and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program."

          "en-US": "Julia: Hi we are students from Cohort 9 of the Lockheed Martin Leadership Institute from Miami University’s CEC department. My name is Julia Schaeffer and I am currently a junior at Miami. As an exec in two clubs and a representative on the council of the league of geeks, I’ve been involved in making several meetings and events as accessible and inclusive as possible. \n\nEunice: My name is Eunice Nsaam and I’m also a junior studying Bioengineering. I’m in an exec position for NSBE and EWB chapters at Miami. Being in these positions, I have become more avidly  aware of some of the issues we have in terms of promoting and encouraging inclusivity in our community both locally and at large.\n\nEunice: On this page, we’ll be talking about accessibility in the workplace from an individual perspective to a group perspective in terms of how we can each work on ourselves individually and as a collective in order to create more accessible spaces whether in discussion or implementation of accessible technologies. \n\nJulia: This is something that drew our attention because as we talk about a future of equal opportunities and utilizing all the available knowledge and tools to advance forward, both technologically and socially, extending these ideas to people with disabilities has often been a  very slow process. In an age where there is a far better understanding of the unique differences and  a growing acceptance of those differences, our actions in the workplace among others should be more and more reflective of that, until it is a part of our way of life.\n\nEunice: There are three major categories that we cover: What is Inaccessible, How to be Inclusive, and Why We Care. These categories work together to explain what we believe to be the path that we are on regarding making life more accessible to everyone. By 2040, we expect inclusivity to be the standard, not the exception. \n"

The first entrance route is a stairway that leads directly to the building’s doorway, and which a number of people are walking up. The second, far longer entrance route consists of a series of ramps that persons who use wheelchairs must use to access the building. One person about to climb the stairway points a person using a wheelchair towards the ramp, as if to reinforce the separation between persons who do and do not have mobility disabilities.\""
